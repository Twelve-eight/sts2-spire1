# This file is a THIN FORWARDING SHELL. The real work - payload refresh, staged-bytes
# held-back scan, VDF quote/backslash, byte-size, description-drift and Markdown guards,
# the login throttle, and the post-push verification - all live in the controlled entry:
#     G:\omp works\.tooling\workshop-push-all.ps1

# one row matches), while its pre-flight guards still run over ALL rows. That is why a
# failure here can never degrade into a full eight-item upload.
